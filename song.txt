You always liked an afterparty, so I guess I shoulda known
Said we hate the paparazzi, now you're somewhere they can't go
I hope you know I'm sorry that I'm not with you right now
Can't pick up when you call me, can't hear it through the clouds

I've been waitin' right outside
Tryna bribe the bouncer
He says, "Not tonight"
